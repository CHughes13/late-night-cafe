## Overview

This is a table booking system for Latte Night Cafe, a late night cafe. Usually only clubs or pubs are open after dark, but not everyone is a party animal. This is a venue for the night owls who want to relax with their friends, or even get some work done, in at a calm and cosy place during the evening and early hours of the morning. Offering customers the chance to book a space allows them to secure a quiet nook for themselves in the early hours of the morning when traditional cafes are normally closed. It also gives them peace of mind that they're in a safe space away from loud music and alcohol-fuelled antics so they can unwind.

## UX/UI
### Site Goals
The goal of Latte Night Cafe is to provide a warm, cosy retreat to those who prefer want to visit coffee shops at night. Minimalic and simple, the aim was to make users feel comfortable and at ease.
![latte-night-cafe-creenshot 2024-08-14 163053](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0ee3f107-2872-4d03-af8e-7ede1debbffe)

The colours are warm and comforting. The main issue with the contrast check was the subtitle here. A text background was added to help it stand out more. This is something that could be altered in the future.

### Features Left to Implement
- __Reviews__ 
  - To give users the choice of quiz difficulty to make the quiz more fun and challenging (this would add replay value). To make the quiz easier, the user could start with 3 answers to choose from instead of 4. Introducing a 50/50 lifeline option that could be used once â€“ this would grey out half of the answers, leaving 1 correct and 1 incorrect.

- __About Page__ 
  - Currently the quiz has the questions hardcoded into it. To provide a wider variety of questions it would be good to find a suitable quiz/question API, such as [Open Trivia Database](https://opentdb.com/)

 __Menu Page__ 
  - Currently the quiz has the questions hardcoded into it. To provide a wider variety of questions it would be good to find a suitable quiz/question API, such as [Open Trivia Database](https://opentdb.com/)
